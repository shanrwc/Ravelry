This project is meant to analyze the amount of yarn needed to complete a certain pattern.  This is done by accessing completely projects in the Ravelry database.

The steps:
-For a given pattern name, find the pattern number.
-For that pattern, find completed projects.
-Of completed projects store the yardage used, the weight of the yarn used, and a score/weight for that data.
-Scores are based on how closely that project appears to match the designer's intention.  Projects made with a dramtically different yarn (sport instead of worsted, for example), or with large alterations (no sleeves, extra repeats, etc.).  Note that this will be really, really tricky to do for multi-sized sweaters, so that will come later.
-Make a histogram of the data, perhaps fit it, and extract reasonable parameters.

Tasks:
0. For testing, use Shetland Border Shawl by Wendy D. Johnson
1. Write code to convert pattern name to pattern number
2. For pattern number, get completed projects and store yardage used and yarn weight.

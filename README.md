BookUse
Goal: Calculate the number of patterns and projects Ravelry users use from a given book of patterns.
Usage: Data from the Ravelry API is collected via the collectData.py script; this is run by a shell script that supplies the access and personal keys.  The data are stored in text files, which are then processed by the plotBookUse.cpp macro.  Plotting uses the ROOT framework published by CERN.

MagUse
Goal: Study the use of patterns from magazines through time.
Usage: Currently similar to that of BookUse.

ProjectPlanner
Goal: Provide a program to create and track progress on knitting or crocheting project completion.
